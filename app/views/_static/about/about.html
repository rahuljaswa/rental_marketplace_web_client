	<h1>About Us</h1>
	<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
		<p>Founded in the heart of Silicon Valley in Palo Alto, BorrowBear was built to address a simple and pervasive problem: depreciation. As consumers, we are constantly purchasing and collecting cameras, sports equipment, tools, machines, video games, clothes, and countless other items. And yet, for 99.9% of the year, these items sit idly collecting dust and losing value.</p>
		<p>BorrowBear was built to allow people around the world to effortlessly generate substantial passive income using the things they already own. And, in so doing, people would be able to rent products that they only need temporarily in a much more convenient and affordable way than is available elsewhere in the world.</p>
		<p>BorrowBear is singlemindedly focused on creating a safe and trustworthy platform to connect owners and renters of products. We hope you find value in what we have built for you.</p>
