Frequent or multiple cancellations will affect the Renter's reputation on BorrowBear and BorrowBear reserves the right to restrict or delete the Renter's account. Cancellations that occur less than 24 hours before the Rental Period start date may incur a 100% charge to the renter at (no refund of the total rental charge) BorrowBear's and the owner's discretion.</p>
