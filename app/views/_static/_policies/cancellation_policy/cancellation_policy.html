		<h2>Renter Cancellation</h2>
		<p>A Renter may cancel a purchase request at their discretion any time before a purchase request has been accepted. However, if a Lender has already accepted and confirmed the purchase request, the Renter must cancel the purchase request 24 hours prior to the start of the Purchase Period in Greenwich Mean Time. Frequent or multiple cancellations will affect the Renter's reputation on BorrowBear and BorrowBear reserves the right to restrict or delete the Renter's account. Cancellations that occur less than 24 hours before the Purchase Period start date may incur a 100% charge to the renter at (no refund of the total purchase charge) BorrowBear's and the owner's discretion.</p>
