	<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
		<p>By signing up as a member and purchasing items, you agree to this Renter Policy as well as any other applicable documents, including Cancellation Policy, Lender Policy, and Web Site Terms and Privacy. The following and aforementioned policies govern your access to and use of BorrowBear, whether as a guest or a registered user. Please read this and the aforementioned policies carefully prior to purchasing items.</p>

		<h2>Operability and Safety</h2>
		<p>The Renter is responsible for using the purchased items in the manner it was designed to be used by manufacturer. The Renter should not use the items in a way that may interfere with the operability of the items or the safe operation of the item.</p>

		<h2>Item Condition and Cleanliness</h2>
		<p>The Renter should keep items in good, working condition (clean and without broken parts). BorrowBear may determine at its' sole discretion whether the purchased items is not maintained well enough by the Renter during the Purchase Period and may charge a Renter for repairs and cleaning due to a Lender’s complaint and BorrowBear’s own investigation. In the event that BorrowBear cancels a Renter’s active Purchase, BorrowBear reserves the right to also not refund any Purchase payment made by the Renter for the item.</p>

		<h2>On Time Purchases</h2>
		<p>If a Renter requests a Listing for a Purchase Period, and the Lender accepts the request, the Renter should be available to meet the Lender on-time, based on the Purchase Period that was accepted by the Lender or proposed by the Lender and accepted by the Renter.</p>

		<h2>Valuables and Property</h2>
		<p>Renters should remove all personal property that is not included in the Purchase Listing before returning the purchased items to the Lender.</p>

		<h2>Eligibility</h2>
		<p>Although it is very rare, BorrowBear may suspend or revoke a Renter’s eligibility to use BorrowBear’s services at any time for any reason, at BorrowBear's sole discretion.

BorrowBear will charge these fees to your purchase payment card on file, to be paid to the Lender or may collect it using alternative billing methods. Lenders may also leave a negative review for the Renter.</p>

		<p>If, as a Renter, you fail to show up for a scheduled Purchase Meeting, the Lender may report it to BorrowBear and leave a negative review for the Renter. Significant or multiple no shows may affect a Renter's ability to purchase items in the future, if BorrowBear believes that the no show(s) has a negative effect on the Lender and the BorrowBear community.</p>

BorrowBear may determine at its' sole discretion whether the information on the Member’s Profile is not accurate, and may suspend the Member until the completion of BorrowBear’s investigation and conversation with the Member to resolve the issue.
