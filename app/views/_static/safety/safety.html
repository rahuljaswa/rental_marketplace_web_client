		<p>Trust & Safety is very important to us and it should be to you too.</p>

		<p>We do everything possible to make sure purchases happen in a safe and secure manner. Learn about what you can do to protect yourself on the BorrowBear marketplace as a renter and lender.</p>

		<h2>Security</h2>

		<p>Safeguards are in place to maintain your safety, secure the information we collect, and prevent unauthorized access. We work with Stripe to ensure your funds are processed quickly and securely. Refuse to make transactions outside of BorrowBear. If you never receive your item, let us know and weâ€™ll send your money back.</p>

		<h2>Transparency</h2>

		<p>BorrowBear provides a number of tools that allow you to verify the identity of the other party. Be sure to check ratings and reviews of the other party to make sure they are trustworthy. Only connect with people you are comfortable meeting in person.</p>

		<h2>Communication</h2>

		<p>We support active communication between lenders and renters. Use our messaging tools to communicate with the other party. Never post your address, email, or phone number online. Keeping messages on BorrowBear will allow us to provide support in the unlikely event of a crisis.</p>

		<h2>Support</h2>

		<p>In the unlikely event something goes wrong, send our customer service representatives a message. We do our best to reply to inquiries within 24 hours.</p>

		<p>The BorrowBear community is one that is built on trust. Anyone who does not respect our guidelines, members of our community, or the items that they borrow will be removed from the marketplace. We have zero tolerance for theft. If it is reported that an item was stolen, we will take serious action.</p>

		<p>To help us make BorrowBear a safe platform for everyone, use the review system to let other renters or lenders know about your experience. Be as honest and truthful as possible.</p>
