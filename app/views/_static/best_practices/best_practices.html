	<h1>Best Practices</h1>
	<div class="col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">
		<h2>Lending</h2>

		<h3>Listing</h3>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>How can I make sure to get visibility on BorrowBear?</h4>
			<p>We encourage you to tag your listings with popular keywords which are searchable by users. For example, if you are renting an Xbox One, you may want to include keywords such as Xbox, Xbox One, Video Game, Gaming, etc. After creating your listings, you should share them via third party networks. We have integrations with Facebook, Twitter, Pinterest, Email, and SMS for one-click sharing.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>How can I make my listing stand out amongst many similar items?</h4>
			<p>The listings that gain the most traction are the ones with the best descriptions and images. Post multiple high quality images that leave few questions about the quality of the item. A lengthy description can also make it easy for renters to gain more information and confidence about your product.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Why is availability important as a lender?</h4>
			<p>Keeping your calendar up to date is an ongoing commitment. You want to make sure you can rent your items on the days they are booked or else you will disappoint users. If you received a rental request for a day in which your calendar should be blocked, send the renter a message and notify our customer service representatives.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>What else can I do to help boost my chances of renting an item?</h4>
			<p>Your profile is a great way to help others learn about you. When you have a robust profile, it helps others feel that you are reliable and trustworthy. As a lender, the more complete your profile is, the more reservations you are likely to book. A great profile includes your name, a photo, and a description of why you joined the BorrowBear community.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Pricing</h3>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>How should I choose my listing’s price?</h4>
			<p>The price you set for your item is completely up to you. In order to gauge an appropriate price you can view listings of similar items in your area. Price can vary substantially based on several factors including availability and seasonality. A good rule of thumb for a daily rental price to be between 2% and 10% of the item’s retail value.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Can I negotiate the price?</h4>
			<p>No, prices you set by are final. We share tips on how to gauge appropriate pricing. While we give you the option to cancel after an item is booked, we keep track of cancellations. Users who abuse the platform in this regard will be notified.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Communication & Exchange</h3>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Where and when should I set the pickup location?</h4>
			<p>In general, we strongly recommend not sharing personal details or addresses with renters. Setting a public pickup location (for example, the Starbucks down the street) is a strongly recommended best practice. In certain areas, we do not allow users to post a personal address. Also, it is strongly recommended to set a time to meet when during the daytime.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Should I communicate with potential renters?</h4>
			<p>We provide messaging tools on our website for you to communicate with potential renters. We actively support communication between lenders and renters. The more contact you have with the other party the more information you will have to gauge their reliability. When you receive a message from a potential renter, you will want to confirm with them the time and location of the exchange. Keeping messages on BorrowBear will allow us to provide support in the unlikely event of a crisis.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Who should I rent my items to? What if I am uncomfortable renting to someone?</h4>
			<p>Only connect with people you feel comfortable meeting in person. We provide a number of tools to allow you to verify the identity of the other party. Be sure to check ratings and reviews to make sure they are trustworthy. If you are unsure of someone’s reliability or feel your safety is in jeopardy, you have the option to decline the request or cancel the booking.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Should I contact my renter after I exchanged the item?</h4>
			<p>We leave this up to you as the lender of the item. In general, it is best practice to leave the other party alone unless the renter reaches out to you with questions or there is an emergency. BorrowBear will automatically send the renter a reminder to return the item.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>What if my renter wants to see the item before renting?</h4>
			<p>Whether or not you allow a renter to see the item beforehand is up to you. This creates extra work for you, but might make it more likely that you rent the item. Remember to only connect with people you feel comfortable meeting in person.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Can I decide not to rent to an interested party?</h4>
			<p>Yes, the decision is up to you. There are many reasons you may not want to rent to an individual. If this is the case, you can decline the request and wait for another party to book the item.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Can I ask a renter to pay in cash during the exchange?</h4>
			<p>Our goal is to build a platform to make it easier for you as a lender generate substantial passive income using the things you already own. Our platform gives you access to thousands of customers and makes it easy for you to collect money for your items. Circumventing our platform to exchange items makes it harder for us to achieve our goals and mission as a company. We hope you find value in what we have built for you.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>What if my renter cancels?</h4>
			<p>By being in communication with the other party you minimize the risk that there will be a cancellation. In the event of a cancellation, we will reopen your calendar so you can rent the item to another user. We also give you, the lender, discretion to cancel a booking if you feel it is necessary.</p>
		</div>

		<h3>Reviews & Disputes</h3>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>How does BorrowBear handle disputes?</h4>
			<p>We collect a security deposit when a rental is confirmed by both parties and the renter agrees to a standard rental agreement with the person providing the item. In case there are any issues, BorrowBear will arbitrate the dispute and provide the owner of the item the fair value of their damages. In most cases, the owner of the product will receive the full replacement cost of the item. Our goal is to provide an attractive platform policy for both owners and renters.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>Am I required to leave a review after the item was returned?</h4>
			<p>You are not required to leave a review, but doing so will help us make BorrowBear a safe platform for everyone. Be as honest and truthful as possible when reporting about your experience.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
			<h4>How can I make sure my renters are satisfied?</h4>
			<p>Renters care about two main things: quality and reliability. Quality: Make sure you deliver your item as represented on the website. The BorrowBear community is one that is built on trust. Misleading users breaks this trust and jeopardizes a positive experience for all parties. Reliability: When you have a firm time and date to exchange an item, be on time. If you are running late, use the messaging tool to send the other party an update.</p>

		</div>

		<div class="faq-section">
