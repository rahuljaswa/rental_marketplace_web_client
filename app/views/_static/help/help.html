			<h3>What happens if something goes wrong with my rental?</h3>
			<p>We collect a security deposit when a rental is confirmed by both parties and the renter agrees to a standard rental agreement with the person providing the item. In case there are any issues, BorrowBear will arbitrate the dispute and provide the owner of the item the fair value of their damages. In most cases, the owner of the product will receive the full replacement cost of the item. Our goal is to provide an attractive platform policy for both owners and renters.</p>

			<h3>Will the renter know who I am?</h3>
			<p>The renter will only be able to see your username. If you use an unrevealing username, the renter will not know your identity unless you disclose it. In general, we strongly recommend not sharing personal details or addresses with renters. Setting a public pickup location (for example, the Starbucks down the street) is a strongly recommended best practice. In certain areas, we do not allow users to post a personal address.</p>
